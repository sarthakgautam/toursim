        Vrindavan is perhaps best known today as one of the most exciting places to celebrate the Spring festival of Holi. Every year, photos of the crowded streets, color-drenched celebrants and vibrant clouds of colored powders fill the newspapers and the Internet.

        Others still have learned in school that Vrindavan was an important place connected to political and religious developments in medieval India. However, none of these delightful aspects of Vrindavan would exist were it not for Divine events and related traditions that have taken place over Vrindavan’s long history.

<p class="culture2">Why is it important to know more about Vrindavan? Because Vrindavan is a singularly unique a place with a power to help us experience, access and even become completely immersed in the divine. Such a place of experiential crossing over between physical worldly realms and dimensions to divine ones is called a tirtha. Vrindavan’s status as a tirtha has made it the center or a number of practices and traditions that make the place important in ways that, while devotional in nature, affect important aspects of life for everyone, regardless of his or her faith.</p>

<p class="music">One of the divinities joining Lord Krishna in his Vrindavan lilas was Vrinda Devi. Considered a form of goddess Lakshmi, Vrinda Devi appears as the tulsi (sacred basil) plant, which covered Vrindavan as an expansive forest. Vrinda Devi helps seekers attain Krishna as She is always close to Him; in fact, it is said that Krishna does not like taking food or flower offerings which are not accompanied by Tulsi. It is for this vast forest of Tulsi that Vrindavan is named: Vrinda means Tulsi, or holy basil, and van is the word for a forest.</p>
